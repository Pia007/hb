#### GRAFF DATA BREACH
<p>
    In November 2021, over a million of Graff's records were compromised in a data breach. Graff is a well known jeweller based in the United Kingdon that maintains a robust elite clientele. The data breach was orchestrated by a group called Conti. Conti used ransomeware to steal the data from the company's servers. Once the group secured the data, it also encrypted Graff's internal systems, which prevented Graff from accssing its own data. To add insult to injury, Conti began publishing the data on the dark web and threatened to publish more if there ransome demands were not met. With the lists of their high profile client's invoices, receipts and credit information being published daily, Graff decided to pay a ransom of over $7.5million to Conti.

    Although Graff did not release specific details of how the attack was orchestrated, the Jewelers’ Security Alliance recommends several measures that can be taken to combat cyber-attacks:
</p>

- Proper firewalls, anti-virus, and anti-malware for all systems, and keep them up to date.

- Don’t allow employees to use company internet-connected devices at work for personal use or download software without permission. Additionally, don’t let them introduce personal memory sticks into a company system.

- Require strong, unique passwords.

- Beware of phishing. One of the main pathways for cyber criminals is to lead someone to open and click on a link in an email which will unleash malware to penetrate the system.

  - So, don’t open or click on unknown or suspicious emails. Even emails from people and customers or vendors that might seem familiar can be spoof emails or from someone who has obtained an email address only slightly different from a real email address. 

  - Additionally, look for unfamiliar foreign domains, misspellings, and other anomalies. 

- Beware of social engineering, which is obtaining confidential information by manipulating and/or deceiving people.

  - Criminals can obtain information on company personnel, customers, ordering, shipping procedures, payment methods, and other information for a fraudulent transaction through impersonation, email correspondence, research on social media, or other means.

- Avoid visiting questionable and risky sites. 

- Don’t download questionable apps from obscure or unknown companies.

- Have a written cyber security policy that employees must read and sign.

- Have regular staff meetings and periodic reviews of cyber protocols for the business.
