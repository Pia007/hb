1.  Check if the POST request accept params, queries, and/or a body.    Which one(s) and what information is it expecting to be sent?
    POST request accepts a body object. It expects a key-value-pair of {"text": "string"}.
2.   What data type does the GET request return?
    The GET request returns an array.
3.  What would the URL look like for deleting the post with the id 555? (This post does not exist anymore, but the syntax is the same for existing posts)
    https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/api/posts/?id=555
4.  List the possible response codes from the GET request at /posts/filter.
    200 and 409
5. Create a post whose text is your name, record the URL and body here:
    https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/api/posts/
    {
        "text": "Pia T"
    }
6. What would the URL and body object be to update the post you just made to contain your faovrite color instead of your name?
    https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/api/posts/?id=1011
7.  What is the URL to get posts that contain the text “blue”?
    https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/api/posts/filter/?text=blue
8.  Make a request to GET all the posts. What are the content type and charset of the response? (Hint: look on the Headers)
    The content-type is application/json.
    The charset type is charset=utf-8.
9.  What would cause a PUT request to return a 409 status?   
    A PUT request would return a 409 status if the request was missing a request query id or a request body.
10. What happens if you try to send a query in the GET request URL? Why do you get that response?
    The server will satisfy the request as long as the query meets the key value pair requirements. This is because a GET request do not have a request body but can request specific data using URL parameters.
